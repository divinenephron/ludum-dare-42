Collapsing Pontoon

[Play on itch.io](https://divinenephron.itch.io/collapsing-pontoon)

My first 2D game, made for Ludum Dare 42, with the theme "running out of space". In the game you guide a bald person with a shiny head across very unstable floating wooden structures. I'd be interested in feedback about whether you could figure out what to do. Made using [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).
